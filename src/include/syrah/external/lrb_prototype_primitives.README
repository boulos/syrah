In June of 2009, Intel provided a LRB prototype primitives header file
(http://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/prototype-primitives-guide/)
to allow prototyping of LRBni-based code before hardware would be
generally available. While Syrah's vector interface works with this
prototype header file correctly, it unfortunately cannot be
distributed directly with Syrah because of the license information at
the top of the file, which as of February 22 2011 reads:

/**

So unfortunately even examining this header file may get you into hot
water. If you'd like to use Syrah with this prototype header file, do
so at your own risk ;). The download link is at the bottom of that
"article".
